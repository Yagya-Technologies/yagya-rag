Several factors affect the sound, including:

1. Amplitude: The intensity of sound is directly proportional to the amplitude of sound.
2. Distance of listener from the source: The intensity of sound decreases as the sound moves away from its source.
3. Density of medium: In gaseous medium, the intensity of sound is directly proportional to its density.
4. Area of vibrating body: If the area of vibrating body is larger, the intensity of the sound is higher.
5. Frequency of sound: The intensity of sound is directly proportional to its frequency.

Additionally, the velocity of sound is affected by:
1. Density of air
2. Temperature of air
3. Humidity of air
4. Direction of air molecules
